## Andy's MakeChange Project

The first class I worked on was the MakeChange class. This class worked fine but was not pretty, and was around 150 lines long. This was excessive.

Thus I created a copy to work on (for fear of breaking the first). I managed to cut the code to 1/3 the size. 

My final hand in is MakeChangeEfficient, however I will leave the original so you can see what I did firstly. Lets see if I can leave this alone ;)

P.S. After all of the talk about the % operator, I wanted to see what I could do without it. I used >= instead to see how far that would take me. It works just fine, and I could have continued using this in the final class, but I decided to do it a % way.
